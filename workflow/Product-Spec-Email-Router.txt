Product: Email Router

1. Introduction
1.1 Business Overview

Our organization handles a high volume of incoming email communications that require timely, accurate responses across multiple departments. Currently, manual email triage and routing creates bottlenecks, delays customer responses, and consumes valuable staff time.

Team members spend significant portions of their workday sorting emails, determining handlers, and forwarding messages. Subject matter experts (SMEs) often receive misdirected inquiries, while routine questions that could be automated consume unnecessary attention.

The Email Router system addresses these challenges by implementing AI-powered email analysis and routing. This system will:

Integrate with existing email infrastructure

Automatically categorize incoming messages

Generate responses for routine inquiries

Route complex communications to the appropriate SMEs

Goal: Reduce response times, ensure consistent communication quality, and free staff to focus on specialized tasks.

1.2 Problem Statement

The current manual approach to email triage and routing presents critical challenges:

Delays as emails pass through multiple hands

Excessive staff time sorting, categorizing, and forwarding emails

Inconsistent handling leading to variable response quality

Important emails overlooked during high-volume periods

Lack of visibility into email traffic

Routine inquiries consuming disproportionate staff attention

Impact: Without an automated solution, operational bottlenecks will continue, response times will increase, and customer satisfaction may decline.

1.3 Current Process

Emails arrive at general departmental inboxes or individual team members

Administrative staff manually review each email

Routine inquiries require searching documentation or consulting colleagues

Complex inquiries forwarded to SMEs through multiple transfers

SMEs review full email threads for context

Responses drafted individually with limited standardization

Follow-up tracked manually (flags, reminders, spreadsheets)

Peak periods cause backlogs and delays

1.4 Scope

Includes:

AI-powered email management system

NLP-based email analysis to determine intent, urgency, and required expertise

Automated response generation for routine emails

Routing of complex inquiries to appropriate SMEs

Dashboard for monitoring performance and bottlenecks

Continuous improvement tools (feedback loops, model training)

Excludes:

Modifications to backend email servers

Internal employee-to-employee communications

CRM integration (future phases)

Mobile app (initial release is web only)
