# Agentic Email Router

## Overview
The Agentic Email Router project demonstrates an AI-powered workflow for analyzing, categorizing, and routing emails automatically. It includes both Phase 1 agents (individual AI components) and a Phase 2 workflow (agentic orchestration).

## Folder Structure
- `agents/` – Phase 1 AI agent scripts
- `workflow/` – Phase 2 workflow orchestration
- `README.md` – Project overview
- `.gitignore` – Ignore environment files and temp files
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Agentic-Email-Router
```

2. Set up Python environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Add your OpenAI API key:
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'" > .env
```

4. Run Phase 1 agents:
```bash
python3 agents/action_planning_agent.py
python3 agents/augmented_prompt_agent.py
# ... run other agents as needed
```

5. Run Phase 2 workflow:
```bash
python3 workflow/agentic_workflow.py
```

## Notes
- You do **not** need to include output folders; outputs are generated by running scripts.
- Ensure `.env` is present with your OpenAI key.
